This tool helps generate the JSON for Q+A entries. It's rough-and-ready, but it helps get the job done.

Note that "<q> ... </q>" can be used as a shortcut for "<span class='quote'> ... </span>", and there is CSS in the main program for this.

Keyboard shortcuts:
  ^p = <p>
  ^i = wrap selected text in <em>
  ^e = wrap selected text in <q>

Keyboard shortcuts (answers only):
  ^X = Yes.
  ^c = No.
