<p> As listed in the Advanced Sequence of Play (ASOP), each phase is usually broken down into three main parts: the START, DURING, END, and several discrete Steps. In each Step Number (e.g. "1.11A"), the players involved are specified as:
<ul>
    <li class=A> ATTACKER
    <li class=D> DEFENDER
    <li class=B> Both
</ul>

<p> Certain mutually exclusive actions may be listed in the same Step, despite the fact that they cannot be conducted by the same unit, and many restrictions normally applicable to the listed actions are left unmentioned. In both cases, the normal rules pertaining to such actions still apply.</p>
