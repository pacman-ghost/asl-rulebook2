<!-- NOTE: ASOP entries should be in separate <div> blocks, with class "entry".
  The Prep Fire data files use different ways of setting these blocks up, for testing porpoises only.
  If you are using these files as a basis for setting up a real ASOP, you can replace them with
  the more normal:
    <div class="entry">
        ...
    </div>
-->

<div foo="bar" class="entry" this="that" > <div class=A> 2.11A </div> <ul>
    <li> Remove his Dispersed SMOKE (checking for any Napalm terrain-Blaze/weapon destruction; G17.41); then flip his SMOKE counters to their Dispersed side (A24.4).
</ul> </div>

{{CONTENT_REMOVED|safe}}

<div class='entry'> <div class=A> 2.15A </div> <ul>
    <li> Check for Column Disbandment (E11.533) and Reverse Slopes (G14.66-.661).
</ul> </div>
