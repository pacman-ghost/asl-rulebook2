<!-- NOTE: ASOP entries should be in separate <div> blocks, with class "entry".
  The Prep Fire data files use different ways of setting these blocks up, for testing porpoises only.
  If you are using these files as a basis for setting up a real ASOP, you can replace them with
  the more normal:
    <div class="entry">
        ...
    </div>
-->

<div class = "foo entry bar"> <div class=A> 2.21A </div> <ul>
    <li> Infantry MMC may become TI and: <ul>
        <li> Mop Up (A12.153) {Casualties; A12.154}, or
        <li> attempt to entrench (A25.21; B27.11; F.1B; G3.5; G13.3; G13.82), placing Labor counter if unsuccessful.
      </ul>
</ul> </div>

{{CONTENT_REMOVED|safe}}

<div class = ' entry '> <div class=A> 2.23A </div> <ul>
    <li> May (un)limber Guns (C10.21; it and crew become TI, if unlimbering).
