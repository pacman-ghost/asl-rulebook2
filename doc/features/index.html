<h2> Basic features </h2>
<p> Out-of-the-box, this program gives you full-text search over the ASLRB index.
<p> It will jump to the exact position in the eASLRB PDF for a rule when you click on a search result.
<p> And if the rule has any associated footnotes, these will be shown in a popup.

<p style="margin-top:1.5em;"> You can also browse the ASLRB by chapter: <br>

<h2> Adding rules for other modules </h2>
<p> Once you've got the program up and running, you can then think about extending it. It's a lot of work, but the results are insanely cool!
<p> To the right, I searched for "cellar", and the program has found results from <em>Red Barricades</em>. The rules for this are referenced in the ASLRB index, but the content is not yet in the MMP eASLRB.
<p> However, I added a PDF scan of the rules, plus information about where each rule is within that PDF (a <em>"targets file"</em>), and so when I click on the <span class="ruleid">O3.3</span> search result, it seamlessly opens the <em>Red Barricades</em> PDF and jumps to that rule.
<br clear="all"> <br>

You can also include third-party modules that are not referenced in the ASLRB index, in this case, LFT's <em>Kampfgruppe Scherer</em>. I added an index for it, which is then also searched. As with <em>Red Barricades</em>, I also added a PDF scan of the rules, and a targets file that specifies the location of each rule, and clicking on the <span class="ruleid">KGS CG9</span> search result takes me directly to that rule in the KGS PDF.
<br>

<p> I also added information about chapters in the PDF's, so that I can browse through them in the usual way: <br>

<h2> Showing Q+A and errata </h2>
Q+A and errata can also be included. This is a <em>lot</em> of work, but the results are amazing. If you click on a rule that has Q+A and/or errata associated with it, they will be shown, alongside the rule you're looking for.
<p> Here, I've searched for <em>"encircled"</em>, and the program has automatically shown Q+A and errata for rule <span class="ruleid">A7.7</span>.
<div class="info"> Note that this errata is actually obsolete, since it's already been incorporated into the current MMP eASLRB, but it's shown here as an example. </div>
<br clear="all">

<p> <img src="images/search-encircled.png" class="imageZoom" style="float:right;width:30%;margin-left:1em;">
Going back to the search results, you can see these Q+A entries included in there.
<p> Note the checkboxes underneath the search box, that let you filter the results by type.
<br clear="all">


<p> <img src="images/user-anno.png" class="imageZoom" style="float:left;width:30%;margin-right:1em;">
<h2> User annotations </h2>
You can also add your own notes to the search engine.
<p> Here, I've added a note about what <em>Majority Squad Type</em> means, and a link back to the Game Squad post that talks about it.
<br clear="all">


<p> <img src="images/asop.png" class="imageZoom" style="float:right;width:40%;margin-left:1em;">
<h2> Advanced Sequence Of Play </h2>
Finally, the ASOP can also be included, with clickable links to each of the referenced rules.
<p> ASOP entries are also included in search results: <br>
